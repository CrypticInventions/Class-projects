When writting the code for this assignment i noticed strong repetition throughout
every block of code. The repeditive blocks of code allowed me to copy and paste most
of my repeating lines which limited my room for syntax error. Although the code
didn't take long to write the output of my lines made me have to switch out my 
println statments with print statments, which then had to include tabs and newlines
to my the output look more appealing.
in the future i will try to plan out the look of my output ahead of time so i
will not have to repeatedly run my code to alter the look of the output.
