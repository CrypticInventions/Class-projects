PROJECT TITLE:01.13 Challenge Program
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of my project is to convert foreign currency into american currency
VERSION or DATE: 8/2/20
AUTHORS: Brandon Hugger

PMR: Whilist writting my program i have learned to calculate differences using modulo
(%) and write code that converts foreign currency into USD. I was stumped when trying to
figure out how to find the amount of money left without using multiplication or division
until i utilized the modulo operation.
In the future i will remember to fully utilize modulo in the appropriate situations
so i can furthur advance my usage of mathmatics in my code.
