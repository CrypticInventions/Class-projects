Writting programs on blue j has been unlike any other idle i have ever used.
I am still getting used to the basic usages of classes when printing out statements
but i hope to furthur my understanding of them to be able to truly realize their potential.
In the future: i will try to pay more attention to the casing of keywords since i am
not yet used to using capitals in my keywords.
