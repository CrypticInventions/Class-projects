PROJECT TITLE: Assignment 01.09
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of my project was to use double and int variables to
solve expressions.
VERSION or DATE: 7/24/20
AUTHORS: Brandon Hugger

When writting my program i came across several issues, one mostly being an issue
with capitalization of variables and the other being the connotation of strings
within my statments. I mostly incountered this problem within my addition expression
since they contained over several addition signs within the statment. 
In the future ill try to make my variables more distinguished from each other so
they'll be more easily identifiable and ill run into less user prone typo errors.
